##version2:
In version2 of MealsOnWheels, it would really nice to have a many-to-many model relationship.  This would allow the Cook User and the Customer user to interface and communicate meals that the Customer would like.

##problems:
The biggest problem on this project was understanding the material (ei. Mongo, Handlebars, Express). Initially, I did not understand the material completely, and there was a delay in getting all the Schemas, Views, Routes, and Controllers to communicate.  By the time I got everything set up and related properly, I was emotionally exhausted.  I believe with more time, I can develope full CRUD for each model leve.
