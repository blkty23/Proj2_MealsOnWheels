#version2:
In version2 of MealsOnWheels, it would really nice to have a many-to-many model.
#problems:
The biggest problem on this project was understanding the material. Initially, I did not understand the material completely, and there was a delay in getting all the Schemas, Views, Routes, and Controllers.
